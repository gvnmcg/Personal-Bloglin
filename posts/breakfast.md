# Breakfast of Champions Review

This novel is more a trip in style.

Describing the world from an alien existential perspective as if everyone were designed as robots.

Two characters converge in a middle of nowhere town.

until then they lead completely differnt lives.

One, Dwayne very successfull and going insnae. 

the other, Kilgore, already insane and coping with writing incredibly goofy stories that examine the normal world as alien occurances. 


## Kilgore 

gets attacked in NYC and then hitchhikes to an arts festival in Midland city where dwayne is covertly ruining his reputation.

He recalls stories he wrotes and has uncomfortable converstaions with his drivers.

## Dwayne

He is a philanthropist.

Everyone knows his ventures.

His inherited childhood perspective is seen as finally catching up a distoring his view of people. 

Its kinda sad, kinda funny.

## Collision.

They meet and everything goes wrong.
